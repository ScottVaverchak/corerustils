# Coreutils... but in rust ðŸ¤”ðŸ¦€

## What?

I'm recreating all of coreutils in rust.

## No, what's a coreutil?

This is a [coreutil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_GNU_Core_Utilities_commands).

## Why rust?

A thread-safe, memory-safe guaranteed ```yes``` would benefit everyone. 

## No, but why?

I want to learn rust. 

## So this will be exactly like Coreutils?
As close as possible. Some options might not be implmented.
