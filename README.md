# Coreutils... but in rust ðŸ¤”ðŸ¦€

## What?

This is a recreation of [coreutil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_GNU_Core_Utilities_commands) in rust. This is for learning and less for use. Anyone mad enough to use this on their computers can buy me a coffee.

## Why rust?

Rust is an interesting language I have been looking into for the past few years. Plus, this will pass the time until Jai is released to the general public.

## So this will be exactly like coreutils?
As close as possible. Some options might not be implmented.

## Status
Anything not listed below hasn't been worked on yet. 

* [yes](#yes)
* [cat](#cat)
* [head](#head)

### yes 

```yes``` is more or less complete. This was the first program implemented. Accept this as my apology for the implementation.

### cat

```cat``` is a standard Unix utility that reads files sequentially, writing them to standard output. The name is derived from its function to concatenate files.  

The following switches will be implemented:

| Switch       | Description                                                                   | Implemented? |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| ```-b```     | Number the non-blank output lines, starting at 1.                             | Yes          |
| ```-n```     | Number the output lines, starting at 1.                                       | Yes          |
| ```-s```     | Squeeze multiple adjacent empty lines, causing the output to be single spaced | Yes          |

All other switches will not be implemented initially (or ever).

Switches I ignored for now:

| Switch   | Description |  
|----------|-------------|
| blank    | This will echo back to you |
| ```-e``` | Display non-printing characters (see the -v option), and display a dollar sign (`$') at the end of each line. |
| ```-t``` | Display non-printing characters (see the -v option), and display tab characters as `^I'. |
| ```-u``` | Disable output buffering. |
| ```-v``` | Display non-printing characters so they are visible.  Control characters print as `^X' for control-X; the delete character (octal 0177) prints as `^?'.  Non-ASCII characters (with the high bit set) are printed as `M-' (for meta) followed by the character for the low 7 bits. |

```-e, -t, -v``` would all seem to use the same logic, so these maybe completed first. 

Performance of the current implementation is questionable and will be revisted when I have a better grasp of rust.

### head

```head``` is a program on Unix and Unix-like operating systems used to display the beginning of a text file or piped data.

The following switched will be implemented:

| Switch   | Description        | Implemented? |
|----------|--------------------|--------------|
| ```-n N``` | Count by N lines | No           |
| ```-c N``` | Count by N bytes | No           | 

If multiple files are passed in the arguments, ```==> XXX <==``` will be printed as the header, where ```XXX``` is the name of the file.
