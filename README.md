# Coreutils... but in rust ğŸ¤”ğŸ¦€

## What?

I'm recreating all of coreutils in rust.

## No, what's a coreutil?

This is a [coreutil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_GNU_Core_Utilities_commands).

## Why rust?

A thread-safe, memory-safe guaranteed ```yes``` would benefit everyone. 

## No, but why?

I want to learn rust.
